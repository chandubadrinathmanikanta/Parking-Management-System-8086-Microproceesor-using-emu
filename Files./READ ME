Hello Guys,

In this folder we have all the requried files to run the Parking Management System using 8086 Assembly Language

Install emu 8086  emulator to run the program and then open the file 

using 8086 emulator and then run the program in the emu

Now, you can watch the outputs as given in the file(as scrren shots have been uploaded)

Finally the program runs 

Note: Here, In the program I've selected only a few number of parking spaces if you want 

you can increase the parking space.
